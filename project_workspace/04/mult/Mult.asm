// Function:
// Multiplication:  The inputs of this program are the current values stored in R0 and R1 (i.e. the two top RAM locations). The program computes the product R0*R1 and stores the result in R2.
//

// Comments: 
//We assume (in this program) that R0>=  0, R1>=  0, and  R0*R1<32768. Your program need not test these conditions, but rather assume that they hold.  The supplied Mult.tst  and Mult.cmp  scripts will test your program on several representative data values.

@R0
M=12
@R1
M=11
